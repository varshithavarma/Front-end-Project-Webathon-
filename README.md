###Purpose of the project:
The project is designed as a solution to the given problem statement "How to provide services to the homeless people. Find a solution to create a greater impact to the lives of homeless people". 
This was proposed in a "Webathon" at VNRVJIET college to my team.
So we designed a front-end web application where details of the homeless people in rural areas are filled using registration page.
Then a unique username is added for every registration.
Along with this people who would like to donate or sponsor for the homeless people can fill in the details and fulfill the needs.
It also displays the schemes that people have been offered who satisfies the requirements which would be easy to get the count of the people who need more care.

###How to run the project:
-Pull out the project.
